- Biodiversity: Tremendous variety of living things
- Biologists have identified and named about 1.8 million species
- Some are similar to each other whereas others are not
- Estimated total number of species on Earth ~ 8.7 million species (give or take 1.3 million).
	-	~6.5 million species found on land
	-	~2.2 million dwelling in the ocean depths.

- Characteristics shared by all cells:
	- Enclosed by a membrane
	- Use DNA as genetic information
- Two main forms of cells: [Prok and Euk](https://www.google.com/search?q=procaryote+and+eukaryote&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwiM--yP2aLzAhXNmnIEHYPCBN4Q2-cCegQIABAA&oq=procaryote+and+eukaryote&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQDDoECAAQQzoKCAAQsQMQgwEQQzoICAAQgAQQsQM6BQgAEIAEOgcIABCxAxBDOgQIABAeOgYIABAIEB5Q8Ng3WNiROGCzpzhoAHAAeACAAcUBiAHpE5IBBDAuMjGYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ8ABAQ&sclient=img&ei=UpRTYYyKLM21ytMPg4WT8A0&bih=601&biw=1280&hl=en)
	- Prokaryotic: lack organelles; DNA not separated in a nucleus
	- Eukaryotic: divided into organelles; DNA in nucleus

- Taxonomy: The science of grouping biological organisms on the basis of shared characteristics (based on common ancestry) and giving names to those groups
---
- At the highest level, life is classified into three domains:
	1. ==Bacteria== (prokaryotes)
	2. ==Archaea== (prokaryotes)
	3. ==Eukarya== (eukaryotes)
		- Eukaryotes include the four kingdoms 
		- Protists, Plantae, Fungi, and Animalia

##### Taxonomy
- The taxonomic classification system uses a hierarchical model.
- A species is placed into progressively smaller groups that are more closely related evolutionarily
	- Each Domain is subdivided into Kingdom, each Kingdom divided into Phylums, each Phylums divided into Classes, and so on…..
- Moving from the point of origin, the groups become more specific, until one branch ends as a single species.
- ==Domain -> Kingdom -> Phylum -> Class -> Order -> Family -> Genus -> Species==

##### The Binomial System
- Developed by Carl Linnaeus in 1700’s laid the foundations for the modern scheme of nomenclature
	- “Father of modern taxonomy”
- Each kind of organism has a unique name
- In this system, each organism gets two Latin names, a genus and a species name. 
- No other organism has it
- Each species has a unique scientific name
1. Genus name capitalized
2. Specific epithet or species descriptor is not capitalized
3. both names are italicized
- For example:
	- *Homo sapiens* = Human
	- *Canis familiaris* = Dog 
	- *Ursus americanus* = Black Bear
	- *Panthers onca* = jaguar
