##### Life's Unity and Diversity
- How do we account for life’s dual nature of unity and diversity?
- The process of evolution explains both the similarities and differences among living things
	- Similarity at the cellular level because we evolved from a common ancestor.
	- Visual differences between organisms are due to various adaptation to their environmental niche. Evolution- Adaption to its Environment

##### Adaption to its Environment
- Evolutionary change involves modifications of characteristics in earlier populations
- Structures may be modified to serve new purposes
	- Ex: limbs used for walking were modified into a dolphin’s flipper or a bat’s wing

##### Natural Selection
- Main steps:
	-	Organisms in a population are not exactly alike (have different traits)
	-	Organisms, reproduce, and must compete for resources to survive
	-	Individuals that are better adapted to obtain resources, more likely to survive and reproduce
	-	Survivors that reproduce pass on their traits (i.e. genes that are favorable for survival)

##### Natural Selection
- It is important to understand that natural selection does not always represent progress, only adaptation to a changing surrounding
	- Adaptive forms results in more common occurrence
	- Less adaptive ones results in less common or eventually disappear
- Because environments are always changing, what was once an advantage trait can become a liability further down the evolutionary line.
