- Organisms have become adapted to their env through evolutionary processes.
- Organisms living on Earth are modified descendents of common ancestors.
- Two mechanisms of evolutionary change: 
	- Vertical Descent (Evolutionary Tree)
	- Horizontal Gene Transfer (Evolutionary Web)
---
- Vertical Descent (Evolutionary Tree): Progression of changes in a lineage.
- New species evolve from pre-exsiting species by the accumulation of mutalations.
- Natural selection takes advantage of beneficial mutalations.
---
- Horizontal Gene Trasfer (Evolutionary Web): Genetic exchange between different species.
- Relatively rare, especially in eukaryotes.
- Ex: Genes that confer antibiotic resistance are sometimes transferred between **different bacteria species**.
---
- Tree of life focueses on vertical evolution.
- Web of life inclues the contribution of horizontal gene transfer.
- Horizontal gene transfer was an important part of the process tha gave rise to modern species.
