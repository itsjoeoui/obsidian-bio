- Homeostasis is the state of steady internal chemical and physical conditions maintained by living systems
- Homeostasis is a self-regulating process that regulates internal variables necessary to sustain life. In other words, homeostasis is a mechanism that maintains a stable internal environment despite the changes present in the external environment.
- Disturbance of homeostasis = disorder, disease and eventually death.

- For a given variable, fluctuations above or below a **set point** server as a **stimulus**.
- These are then detected by a **sensor** and trigger a **response**.
- The response returns the variable to the set point.
- Ex: Temp, blood pH, water, blood glucose, ions like Na<sup>+<sup/>

- Hyperthermia: when body produces/absorbs more heat than it can dissipate. 
	- 40+: life-threatening
	- 41+: brain death
	- 45+: RIP
- Hypothermia: when body temp drops below that required for normal metabolism and body functions. 
	- 34-36: shivering
	- 33: lose consciousness
	- 30: pulse and respiration rate decreases, major organs fail and clinical death occurs
