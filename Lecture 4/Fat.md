- Importance in Biological Systems.
	1. ==Energy storage==
		- 1g of fat stores more energy than 1g of glycogen or starch
	2. ==Insulation cold== (ex. whales and seals)
	3. ==Protection of internal organs==
---
- Fats are constructed from two types of smaller molecules:
	- ==Glycerol== is a three-carbon alcohol with a hydroxyl group attached to each carbon
	- ==Fatty acids==
---
- Fatty acids are the building blocks of the fat in our bodies and in the food we eat. 
- During digestion, the body ==breaks down fats into fatty acids==, which can then be absorbed into the blood. 
- Fatty acid molecules are usually joined together ==in groups of three==, forming a molecule called a ==triglyceride (triacylglycerol)==. Triglycerides are also made in our bodies from the carbohydrates that we eat.
- The fatty acid tail hold a lot of energy
- Fatty acid tails varies in length therefore diversity
- Fatty acids vary in length (# of carbons) and in the # and locations of double bonds
---
### Saturated Fats
- Fats made from saturated fatty acids are called saturated fats
- Saturated fatty acids have the ==maximum number of hydrogen atoms== possible and ==no double bonds==
- ==Most animal fats are saturated==
- Saturated fats are ==solid== at room temperature
---
 ### Unsaturated Fats
- Fats made from unsaturated fatty acids are called unsaturated fats
- Unsaturated fatty acids have ==one or more double bonds==
- Plant fats and fish fats are ==liquid== at room temperature and are called oils
- **The double bond kinks and the chains can not pack closely together and are thus liquid at room temp**
- Certain unsaturated fatty acids are not synthesized in the human body
- These must be supplied in the diet
- Omega-3 fatty acids are considered essential fatty acids
---
### Trans Fats
- ==Hydrogenation== is the process of converting ==unsaturated fats to saturated fats ==by ==adding hydrogen==
- Hydrogenating vegetable oils also creates ==unsaturated fats with trans double bonds== **(does not bend)**
- These trans fats may contribute more than saturated fats to cardiovascular disease created as a side effect of partial hydrogenation of plant oils but also occurs naturally i.e. meat and dairy products
