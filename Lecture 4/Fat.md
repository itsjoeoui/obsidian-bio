- Importance in Biological Systems.
	- Energy storage
		- 1g of fat stores more energy than 1g of [[Glycogen]] or [[Starch]]
	- Insulation cold (ex. whales and seals)
	- Protection of internal organs
---
- [[Fat]]s are constructed from two types of smaller molecules:
	- Glycerol is a three-[[Carbon]] alcohol with a hydroxyl group attached to each [[Carbon]]
	- [[Fatty acid]]s
---
### Saturated Fats
- [[Fat]]s made from saturated [[Fatty acid]]s are called saturated fats
- Saturated [[Fatty acid]]s have the maximum number of hydrogen atoms possible and no double bonds
- Most animal fats are saturated
- Saturated fats are solid at room temperature
---
 ### Unsaturated Fats
- Fats made from unsaturated [[Fatty acid]]s are called unsaturated fats
- Unsaturated [[Fatty acid]]s have one or more double bonds
- Plant fats and fish fats are liquid at room temperature and are called oils
- The double bond kinks and the chains can not pack closely together and are thus liquid at room temp
- Certain unsaturated [[Fatty acid]]s are not synthesized in the human body
- These must be supplied in the diet
- Omega-3 [[Fatty acid]]s are considered essential [[Fatty acid]]s
---
### Trans Fats
- Hydrogenation is the process of converting unsaturated fats to saturated fats by adding hydrogen
- Hydrogenating vegetable oils also creates unsaturated fats with trans double bonds (does not bend)
- These trans fats may contribute more than saturated fats to cardiovascular disease Created as a side effect of partial hydrogenation of plant oils but also occurs naturally i.e. meat and dairy products
