- A [[Polymer]] is a long molecule consisting of many similar building blocks called [[Monomer]]s.
- Example: [[Glycogen]], [[Polypeptide]], and [[DNA]].
---
- A condensation reaction (aka a dehydration reaction) occurs when two [[Monomer]]s bond together through the loss of a water molecule. 
- [[Polymer]]s are disassembled to [[Monomer]]s by hydrolysis.
---
- [[Enzyme]]s are [[Macromolecule]]s that speed up the dehydration process.
