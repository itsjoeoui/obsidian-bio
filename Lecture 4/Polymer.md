- A polymer is a long molecule consisting of many similar building blocks called monomers.
- Example: [[Glycogen]], [[Polypeptide]], and [[DNA]].
---
- ==A condensation reaction== (aka a dehydration reaction) occurs when ==two monomers bond together== through the loss of a ==water molecule==. 
- Polymers are disassembled to monomers by ==hydrolysis==.
---
- ==Enzymes== are macromolecules that speed up the dehydration process.
