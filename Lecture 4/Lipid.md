- Lipids are the one class of large biological molecules that ==do not form polymers== (not true polymers)
- The unifying feature of lipids is that they all have ==little or no affinity for water== (hydrophobic) and therefore, very ==insoluble in water==
- This is because they consist mostly of ==hydrocarbons==, which form ==nonpolar covalent bonds== (mainly : C, H, O)
- The most biologically important lipids are:
	1. [[Fat]]s
	2. [[Phospholipid]]s
	3. [[Steroid]]s
