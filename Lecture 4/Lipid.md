- [[Lipid]]s are the one class of large biological molecules that do not form [[Polymer]]s (not true [[Polymer]]s)
- The unifying feature of [[Lipid]]s is that they all have little or no affinity for water (hydrophobic) and therefore, very insoluble in water
- This is because they consist mostly of hydrocarbons, which form nonpolar
covalent bonds (mainly : C, H, O)
- The most biologically important [[Lipid]]s are:
	1. [[Fat]]s
	2. [[Phospholipid]]s
	3. [[Steroid]]s
