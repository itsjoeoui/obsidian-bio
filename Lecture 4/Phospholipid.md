- Phospholipids are the major component of all ==cell membranes==
- Two components:
	1. ==Phospholipid molecules==
	2. ==[[Protein]] molecules==
- In a phospholipids ==two fatty acids== and ==a phosphate group== are attached to ==glycerol==
- The two fatty acid tails are ==hydrophobic==, but the phosphate group and its attachments form a hydrophilic head
	- Amphipathic molecule

- (In chemistry, hydrophobicity is the physical property of a molecule that is seemingly repelled from a mass of water. In contrast, hydrophiles are attracted to water.)
