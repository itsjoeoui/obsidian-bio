- [[Phospholipid]]s are the major component of all cell membranes
- Two components:
	1. [[Phospholipid]] molecules
	2. [[Protein]] molecules
- In a [[Phospholipid]]s two[[Fatty acid]]s and a phosphate group are attached to glycerol
- The two [[Fatty acid]] tails are hydrophobic, but the phosphate group and its attachments form a hydrophilic head
	- Amphipathic molecule
