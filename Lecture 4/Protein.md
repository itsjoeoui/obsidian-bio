- Proteins account for more than 50% of the dry mass of most cells
- The digestive system break down the [[Protein]] in food into basic units, called amino acids (the [[Monomer]]s)
- The [[Amino acid]]s then can be reused to make the [[Protein]]s your body needs to maintain muscles, bones, blood, and body organs, etc.

 ### Protein Structure
- More complicated than “carbs”
- Greater variety of [[Monomer]]s (20 aas)
- Usually much larger than a [[Carbohydrate]]
- Different [[Protein]] molecules have their own distinct shape
- A functional [[Protein]] consists of one or more [[Polypeptide]]s twisted, folded, and coiled into a unique shape
- The sequence of [[Amino acid]]s determines a [[Protein]]’s three-dimensional conformation
- A [[Protein]]’s conformation determines its function
---
### Four Levels of [[Protein]] Structure:
- Primary Structure
- Secondary Structure
- Tertiary Structure
- Quaternary Structure
---
##### Primary Structure
- Primary structure, the sequence of [[Amino acid]]s in a [[Protein]], is like the order of letters in a long word
- Primary structure is determined by inherited genetic information
- Number and Sequence of [[Amino acid]]s that make up the [[Protein]]
- 1-2-3-4-5 not the same as 1-2-3 or 1-2-3-4-5-6-7
---
##### Secondary Structure
- The coils and folds of secondary structure result from hydrogen bonds between repeating constituents of the [[Polypeptide]] backbone
- Typical secondary structures are a coil called an alpha helix and a folded structure called a beta pleated sheet
- Shortens the chain makes it more compact
---
##### Tertiary Structure
- Tertiary structure is determined by interactions between R groups, rather than interactions between backbone constituents
- These interactions between R groups include hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals interactions
- Strong covalent bonds called disulfide bridges may reinforce the [[Protein]]’s conformation
---
##### Quaternary Structure
- Quaternary structure results when two or more [[Polypeptide]] chains form one [[Macromolecule]]
- Collagen is a fibrous [[Protein]] consisting of three [[Polypeptide]]s coiled like a rope
- Hemoglobin is a globular [[Protein]] consisting of four [[Polypeptide]]s: two alpha and two beta chains
