- Proteins account for more than 50% of the dry mass of most cells
- The digestive system break down the protein in food into basic units, called ==[[Amino acid]]s== (==the monomers==)
- The amino acids then can be ==reused to make the proteins== your body needs to maintain muscles, bones, blood, and body organs, etc.

 ### Protein Structure
- ==More complicated than “carbs”==
- ==Greater variety== of monomers (20 aas)
- Usually ==much larger than a carbohydrate==
- Different protein molecules have their own ==distinct shape==
- A functional protein consists of ==one or more polypeptides== twisted, folded, and coiled into a unique shape
- ==The sequence of amino acids determines a protein’s three-dimensional conformation==
- A protein’s ==conformation determines its function==

### Four Levels of Protein Structure:
- Primary Structure
- Secondary Structure
- Tertiary Structure
- Quaternary Structure
---
##### Primary Structure
- Primary structure, the sequence of amino acids in a protein, is like the order of letters in a long word
- Primary structure is determined by ==inherited genetic information==
- ==Number== and ==Sequence== of amino acids that make up the protein
- 1-2-3-4-5 not the same as 1-2-3 or 1-2-3-4-5-6-7

##### Secondary Structure
- The ==coils and folds== of secondary structure result from ==hydrogen bonds== between repeating constituents of the ==polypeptide backbone==
- Typical secondary structures are a coil called an alpha helix and a folded structure called a beta pleated sheet
- Shortens the chain makes it more compact

---
##### Tertiary Structure
- Tertiary structure is determined by ==interactions between R groups==, rather than interactions between backbone constituents
- These interactions between ==R groups== include hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals interactions
- Strong covalent bonds called disulfide bridges may reinforce the protein’s conformation

---
##### Quaternary Structure
- Quaternary structure results when ==two or more polypeptide chains== form one ==macromolecule==
- Collagen is a fibrous protein consisting of three polypeptides coiled like a rope
- Hemoglobin is a globular protein consisting of four polypeptides: two alpha and two beta chains

##### Sickle-Cell Disease: A Simple Change in Primary Structure
- A slight change in primary structure can affect a protein’s conformation and ability to function
- Sickle-cell disease, an inherited blood disorder, results from a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)
- Caused by A to T substitution of the β-globin gene, which results in glutamic acid to be substituted by valine
