- Molecular components attached to that [[Carbon]] skeleton that give molecule distinctive chemical properties
- Each type of functional group exhibits the same properties in all molecules in which it occurs in.
- Tiny differences in ==chemical structure== (Functional group) can lead to profoundly different biological properties. Ex: estrogen vs. testosterone. (female vs. male lion)
