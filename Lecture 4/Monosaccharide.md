- Monosaccharides serve as a major fuel for cells and as raw material for building molecules
- Example: [[Glucose]], [[Fructose]] and [[Galactose]]
- Both simple sugars [[Glucose]] and [[Fructose]] contain 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms.
- They both share the same chemical formula C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>. The difference is in how the atoms are arranged in each molecule.
- Substances which have ==identical molecular formulas== but ==different structural formulas== are called ==structural isomers==
