### [[Amino acid]] [[Monomer]]s
- [[Amino acid]]s are organic molecules with carboxyl and amino groups
- [[Amino acid]]s differ in their properties due to differing side chains, called R groups
- There are 20 a-amino acids that are relevant to the make-up of mammalian [[Protein]]s

### [[Amino acid]] [[Polymer]]s
- [[Amino acid]]s are linked by peptide bonds
- A [[Polypeptide]] is a [[Polymer]] of [[Amino acid]]s
- [[Polypeptide]]s range in length from a few [[Monomer]]s to more than a thousand n Each [[Polypeptide]] has a unique linear sequence of [[Amino acid]]s
