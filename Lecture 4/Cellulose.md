- A common example of an indigestible [[Polysaccharide]] made of repeating units of [[Glucose]].
- Humans lack the [[Enzyme]] necessary to digest [[Cellulose]].
- It is an important form of dietary fiber in the human diet.
- Like [[Starch]], [[Cellulose]] is a [[Polymer]] of [[Glucose]], but the glycosidic linkages differ.
- The difference is based on two ring forms for [[Glucose]]: alpha (a) and beta (b)
- [[Starch]]: alpha 1-4 linkages and beta 1-4 linkages
	- [[Polymer]]s with a [[Glucose]] are helical
	- [[Polymer]]s with b [[Glucose]] are straight
